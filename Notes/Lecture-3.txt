# Notes

- instead of writing "npx parcel index.html" to build the project, we can add a script to the package.json,
    saying that `start: "parcel index.html" `. 
- Now we just have to run "npm start" or "npm run start" to build the project. 
- jsx is not technically javascript. Js engine cannot understand it. Babel converts it into js 
- React.createElement => React element (js object) => HTML element (render)
- JSX => React.createElement => React element (js object) => HTML element (render)
- Babel also deals with newer js incompatible with older browser. 
- jsx escapes data from a malicious apis. 

Component: 
- Class based - old way of writing code
- functional component - new way of writing code.
