# Notes

- In one file we can have only 1 default export 
- but we can have multiple named exports. 
- For named exports (data from constants.js) : export const CDN_URL = "www.xyz.com";  
- whenever a state variable changes, react rerenders the component.  
- the update part is what is extremely expensive, and where react is very very good. 

# Hooks: 

There are 2 most important hooks: 
1. useState()
    - import {useState} from 'react'
    - imported as a named import
    - returns an array
    - const [listRestaurants] = useState();
    - as arguments, we can pass values as [], null or [{data for 1 restaurant}] 
    - the way to set it is to use another variable. const [resList, setResList] = useState ([])
    - how to update?? --> setResList(newResList)


2. useEffect()


# Why is react fast?? 
- React uses reconciliation algorithm. Also known as react fiber. 
- Virtual DOM: not the actual DOM, representation of the actual DOM. The components are basically virtual DOMs. its a JS object. 
- Diff algorithm: Finds out the difference between the updated virtual DOM and the previous virtual DOM.
